Hello my friends, welcome back to my channel. In this video, I'm gonna be reading all of the Game Changer series by Rachel Reed and also telling you thoughts and feelings on huge rivalry. The TV show, I've hinted at the fact I've been watching that I've been enjoying, but now that the show is completely out, I want to give you all of my ranty thoughts and feelings. But ranty, I mean, ravey because I am obsessed with a show. It is so transformative in so many ways, but we'll yap about that later. Before we get into it, I have to tell you about this monster of today's video, Masterclass. Masterclass is a membership to classes from the world's best. I'm sure you've seen ads from Masterclass and even me who lives under a rock, also seen ads from Masterclass. And I've always been interested because all of their advertisements feature people that I'm already familiar with, like Amy Polar, Joanna Gaines, and they promised to teach me about things that they're already knowledgeable about. And after trying it, I have to say it is one of the most valuable subscriptions that I have. I've accessed over 200 courses and thousands of lessons across subjects like business, writing, science and tech, cooking and health wellness, for just $10 a month, build annually. I think last time I talked to y'all about Masterclass, I was talking to you about Peter Etia's course, which I absolutely devoured, but lately I've been loving Margaret Atwood's class on creative writing. It's not a very well-kept secret. I feel like I've talked about it so much over the past two years, but I am trying to write a book of my own, and it is incredibly daunting starting from ground zero. Margaret Atwood is a literal legend, so to have her expertise, and of course, where she breaks down everything for me, who's been genuinely a game changer. Every bit of the course has been super helpful for me, but the thing that has really stuck with me the most is actually maybe the most simple thing, which is her lesson on story structure. Something I was really having a hard time with was how many characters I was trying to introduce into my story and the way in which I was going to tell my story. I think what was most helpful was whenever she said that she paired back on the characters in her story, and she actually looked at the first 10 pages that she had written and realized, well, I have so many characters, but they're doing absolutely nothing, and I was like, oh, very relatable, something I'm having a problem with. And she said instead to eliminate some of the characters, just sit down and write the story front to back. And then when you're finished, you can mess around with how it's structured, or how many additional characters you want to add. Keep it simple first. And I was like, you know what? It's pretty brilliant. And of course, you know, Margaret Atwood's the one delivering that message. But hey, maybe you love books, but you don't like writing, like I do. If you're into something like business or psychology, Masterclass has your back because again, 200 courses plus new classes added every single month, stream anywhere, anytime at your own pace, means learning a new skill on your own schedule. And during the solidy season, you can get up to 50% off an annual Masterclass subscription. Just click the link in the video description or use the QR code on the screen so they know that I sent you. It's the perfect last minute gift for anyone on your list. Learn from the world's best to become your best with Masterclass. Happy he did Revel Refinally Day by friends. It is December 26th when I am sitting down to start this vlog. Stay finale day. I did watch it in fact last night at 11 p.m. Central time. Since watched it a couple times, I've since watched a live reaction by the empty netters podcast on YouTube. All of my viewing experiences have been fabulous. And I will talk more about the show. The end of this video, I just didn't want to bog the video down too much. My thoughts because I could yeah, probably for hours about how important the show is. How special it is. How much it means to me personally. But I will leave it by saying. I think it was the perfect conclusion to the series. This is by far the best adaptation I've ever seen. Especially for romance, but just like generally speaking, best adaptation ever. Stunning, beautiful, extra jaggob-teer-nie. You deserve all the love, all the praise, all of the words. In the acting, of course, is outstanding. But I decided I wanted to read the Game Changer series. I have read a heated Revel Re actually read it back in 2019. Feels weird because I didn't realize I had read it so close to it coming out. I just recommended this book by one of my friends who reads a ton of male male romance and said this one was great. And she was right. It was absolutely incredible. It's a book that I think about over the years and I definitely recommend to people. But for some reason, I'd never felt compelled to read any of Rachel Reed's other books, which feels weird because this is kind of her bread buttered. Like she writes, male male hockey romances. I love heated Revel Re. I think maybe part of it was that this one felt so special and so different. I didn't think anything could compare. I don't think anything ever will, however. I'm going to read the entire Game Changer series in this video to perhaps maybe cure myself of the hangover that I'm experiencing. Every time a new episode of this TV show comes out, I feel like I'm incapable of doing anything for like days at a time. And right now I just feel so emotionally wrong out. I need to like hop into something. And normally, I feel like I would allow myself to just like chill and watch the show a million times, but no. I want to hit my good reed tweeting challenge. And I also want to like read these books with all of you. So that's what we're doing in this video here today. At the end of the video, I'll probably give you my thousand feelings on the show because it was truly remarkable. And if you were curious about my thousand feelings on Rachel Reed's two standalone books, you can check that out over on Patreon or channel memberships. I've already read those books. Both spoilers were really, really good. I've closely vlogged them with my stupid little mini-mic. So if you want to see that, head on over to Patreon and subscribe or you can buy the video if you want to or you can subscribe over here on YouTube. Anyway, Game Changer is the book that I started with. Of course, it's book number one and it is Scott and Kim's book. I will say having watched the show, I didn't know what to expect going into Scott and Kim's book. I feel like the show is this sort of like fast-moving, insta-love sort of story. And maybe that's just because it was condensed into one episode or at least that's what I thought, picking up the book. I can definitely say there is an element of insta-love to their story. Maybe not quite as intense as the show, but it definitely is there. This book follows Scott and Kim. Scott is an MLH is what they call him the show, but in NHL Player, he is the captain of a New York hockey team. And he has been playing for quite a few years. He is a closeted gay man. Had some hookups over the years, but he has never really been in a serious relationship. And he is pretty alone in life. His mom is a single mom before she passed away. And Scott has had pretty fortuitous circumstances other than that, like pretty great situations he's found himself in. He got a hockey scholarship for college and he went to this boarding school, which in free. And he has had a pretty good life, but he's never really had people around him. And I think that this story is really him finding someone in-kipped. Does it feel maybe a little bit vast the way that they're moving? Yes, but I can understand Scott wanting to grab on to anything good that comes his way, right? Scott ends up meeting this guy, Kim, who makes him a smoothie on the day of one of his games. He's been on kind of a losing streak and learned this very banana smoothie propels him into a win. And he decides that he's going to continue to visit the shop effort to like repeat, perform, I guess, or like, you know, game day ritual sort of thing. So we continue to go back. He continues to see this guy named Kip. And he is like really attracted to him. He's like this guy's hot and he's making me good smoothie. And after a couple of different encounters that they have, both at this location and at a special event that Kip is working as part of the catering staff, Scott and Kip end up going on a date, which leads to a little bit of, um, boom, boom, fun, if you will. Probably the first time I've ever said that and hopefully the last, Scott and Kip hook up. They continue to do that. And unlike the TV show, don't end up, um, like, moving in together, basically, immediately. But Scott and Kip do like spend Valentine's Day together, and they are hugging a blah and just having a lot of fun together. Honestly, it's just fun. Initial thoughts when picking this one up were that I was kind of surprised at the writing of this story. I think maybe I did myself a disservice in reading Rachel's newest books, which I believe are the two standalones time to shine. And I really need to look up the name of the other book. I feel like those books, the writing is actually really solid. And I, it doesn't distract me or take me out of the story. This book feels like it's written like fanfiction. It is very clearly this author's first book. And I don't say that in a shady way. I think that's just normal. And it is really cool to see how her writing has progressed. Getting into the story kind of took me a second because I was like, okay, a lot of unnecessary details and it feels a little bit tell and not really show. Like it just felt a little bit. What's the word I'm looking for? Amateurish, which feels again unkind. And I don't mean it that way. It just kind of is the case. I think everyone improves with time with their writing. Okay, that was one of the first things that I really picked up on. And then the second one is that I'm surprised by the sex in this book. Not surprised at anything that's happening, but I'm surprised that I'm finding the sex hot to be honest. Don't like when characters hook up really early on in books. And Keated Rivalry really surprised me and was one of the first books I can remember that I have read that has sex as a form of connection and storytelling. Characters hook up and that eventually leads to an emotional conversation. And also, they have sex and engage with each other, changes over time based on how close they're getting emotionally. And that was really cool for me to see because I feel like I had been in a drought for a while of reading these books that had much smut and yet nothing was really being told through those scenes. It was just like, okay, the natural beat of the story that like these two are going to fuck. It didn't feel like it was really adding to the plot or the connection between the characters, right? Keated Rivalry showed me there was another way. And this book, you know, there's hookups really on. It doesn't have that we're using sex as communication. Thing or at least it didn't feel like that to me. I just didn't know how I would feel about so many sexians, so upfront in this book, but surprisingly it works. I think it's just the way that Rachel writes her sexians. I feel like it's pretty hot. I feel like these scenes are hot. I think that even though the sexians, again, don't have quite as much like depth or storytelling behind them is maybe something like Keated Rivalry. I am all like wanting to read the scenes. I'm not like, okay, let me just fucking skim over these on board. Like, okay, no, I see this. Like, they're, I don't know, they are, maybe they are kind of communicating more through their sex now. I'm having a fun time with it. I think is what I would say. Like, sure that this isn't going to be a five star read, but I am liking it. It is just fun to read different characters than Jane and Ilya. Like, they're so specific and so distinct to me. And so to read characters who are so completely different. And in completely different parts of their lives, I think it's fun. Keated is pretty openly gay, I believe. And Scott is not. Scott has, you know, hooked up with other dudes, whereas like Shane hadn't. So yeah, it's definitely a different kind of story, but it's story that I am enjoying. Also enjoying not having a bandaid on my thumb. I am sort of kind of regretting it. I was like, oh, maybe I'll like finally take it off. It's not gonna focus on my flesh wound. I don't know if I said this in another video, but I did slice my thumb open on a razor. And it was crazy. And I almost passed out. And I was humble on really exciting stuff. I've had a bandage on it for like over a week at this point. And I was like, you know what? It's time to take it off. Is it? Because this whole like, how do my thumb feel so fucking weird? I don't care about that. I'm gonna finish this book and we can move on to heated rivalry. Yes, I've already read it, but who doesn't want to reread? It doesn't want to reread. I am scared to reread the long game. The Holy Shit. My friends finished game changer. 50% in heated rivalry. And I have so many thoughts. So first of all, I think what is striking to me about game changer is, well, similar it is actually to heated rivalry. Not in tone, not in characters, but in plot points that get reused and recycled in did rivalry. I prefer almost all of the moments in heated rivalry. But I just find it interesting that there are so many similarities. We've got the use of the word sweetheart as a term of endearment, got a moment, wear a kip, and Scott are at the same gala. And they can't touch each other, but they're planning to fuck afterwards. It's kind of reminding me a little bit of like Vegas bathroom scene a little bit. We also have got there. They're just literally so many parallels. I could rattle them off. I was making a list on my phone, but I don't think it's like super important to tell you every single one of them. There are a lot of similarities, which surprised me. I will say I kind of already said this pacing of the book works a little bit better than the pacing in the show. What I found may be interesting about the book as opposed to the show is I feel like the transition or kip being okay versus not okay with their arrangement. AKA Scott being in the closet not wanting to come out. I found it to be kind of a weird transition in the book. In the show, we have like a direct close like causal situation, right? We've got like Scott and Kip going to this art gallery. Scott kind of freaking out. He like wants to be public, but he doesn't really know how to approach that. And Kip is starting to realize like this is the reality of being with this man. That's going to be challenging for me. And I already don't like that I'm like to my parents and stuff. We're already getting that. It was pretty evident in the show because Jacob Terni is an amazing interpreter of books. Feel like in the book the transition was a little strange for me. We do have a situation where Kip and Scott go out in public, but it's before that the Kip is starting to sort of grow uncomfortable with the fact that their relationship is a secret, but it did feel like it came on kind of out of nowhere. And I didn't it's all that I can't understand where that's coming from, like just generally speaking, but I don't feel like it was very justified in the book if that makes sense. I also feel like this book was very sweaty and this one was great. I mean Rachel Riedon said her way around sexy and I think that sex was important to their relationship, but I think in you did rivalry it gets away with the sex because it is again more a form of connection. The kinds of sexions change in relation to how their relationship is going, whereas I feel like Scott and Kip, their sex is pretty intimate to start. It's a little bit less of a narrative device also in heated rivalry. I found that the relationship development was there and also a little bit more subtle. And or I could like buy into it more, you've got two hockey players passionate about the same thing, right? They're both at the top of their careers, care about the same thing, so you don't have to do a lot of work to convince me that these two are into each other, right? Like, they like to use each other's bodies, we get that, but also they're like into the same things. They like hockey, they're competitive, that sort of thing, whereas I feel like Scott and Kip's connection feels a little bit more insta-loved and maybe a little less justified because what are the common interests there besides just like, oh you're nice and I want to fuck you? I liked that God wanted to get to know Kip, like there are multiple times where he says I want to know everything about this man, but we don't really learn much about Kip, beyond him like wanting to get a master's degree that he can get a job at like a museum. It was a sweet story, it was certainly a sweet book, and obviously God and Kip's story matters, but I felt like it wasn't maybe like my most favorite, shall we say. One one positive thing I will say in addition to hopefully some of the other positive things I've said is that I really did enjoy the coming out, like the the kiss that happens and the reaction from Scott's team, everybody is like fairly supportive of the fact that Scott is coming out, which I really really liked, and it didn't feel it didn't feel super scary, it didn't feel unrealistic, but it also didn't feel scary, and I think that that is really reassuring and nice. You know, a lot of us have read scary coming out stories repeatedly where people's you know families just own them or the people around them hate them, and it's nice to read stories where that is just not the case, so I like this book, it's sweet, not my favorite, but still a good book. I'm reading Hit and Rivalry for probably like the third or fourth time this year, to be honest. I've read bits and pieces of it multiple times as sort of like a warm-up to episodes that have been coming out. I'm very familiar with the book at this point, familiar with the timeline, I know the order of things at this point, and at the 50% mark we are right before Tampa if that helps you. It is so weird, I will say reading this this time around because I've seen the show. It is so faithful but also so tonally different, I would say. I can't tell which I like more. It's so it's tough here. Let me try to articulate my feeling. Shall we? Jane is different in the book. Jane is autistic, we know this, Rachel where you saw this, and he definitely feels that way in both the book and the show, but I think the show shines is letting Hudson really go there with the emotions, getting to see the tears glisten in his eyes at some of these more emotional storybeats. Also making some of these storybeats emotional where they were not in the book, I think is very masterful on the part of Jacob Tierney because it's like how do you get people to care? Bell these characters from the beginning. If we're not showing those little moments of emotion upfront, right? I don't want to go from enemies to lovers too quickly, but you do want little nuggets of you hurt my feelings, retreat, right? You want the like forward action and you want the retreat. That means that's like how to build a romance. Just fun fact if you're trying to write a romance. In the book, what I have found interesting upon reread is how much Shane keeps inside does not show anything to Ilya. That theorem seen the first few times I read this book didn't really mean much to me. It didn't feel like an emotional point in the story. It just felt like, Jane is pissed off. He feels a little bit rejected, but Ilya doesn't take him that seriously in the bathroom. He's like kind of joking. He doesn't act like he is in the way that he does in the show. It's very different. He's not responding to Shane's emotion or even trying to see through what it really feels like. He's excited to like hook up with Shane and he feels guilty about the fact that he wants to hook up with Shane, but he doesn't understand how Shane is feeling. I don't think in the book. The show he does. Or at the very least, he tries to understand. He reacts very well. I told myself I wasn't going to talk about the show that much, but I think it's important and relevant here. If you watch Connor's story's face, he's got his arm up on the paper towel dispenser or whatever. He is grinning like a fucking clown when he comes in. And when he makes eye contact with Hudson is smile falls and you can see that happen and you can see him lock in and understand that like this is going to be an emotional moment. And you can see him respond to the emotion throughout the entire scene. You don't feel that in the book and not only do you not feel that it is not really there. Like it's not meant to be there. I find that interesting and I see that so much in this book as I'm reading. There's so many moments where Shane is in his head, but he shows none of that to Ilya. He is a lot harsher towards himself and his feelings towards Ilya. He's also a lot harsher to Ilya, I would say. He doesn't have as many moments of, again, that emotional vulnerability. My delivery in the book feels different than in the show in many circumstances. It's interesting. I think that the book in many ways feels a little bit more melancholy, a little bit more distanced. And I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I think that's actually what drew me to the book in the first place. Part of me misses some of that in the show. Part of me kind of wishes that had been a, I don't want to say more cruelty at the beginning, but like little bit of that. But also I like, I have no overtakes with the fucking show. It was so good. So I don't know. It's very interesting reading this for a third, fourth. I don't even know how many times I've read this fucking book at this point. I'm enjoying it. I really truly am. And I think again, another interesting thing is seeing how certain lines of dialogue are taken from certain scenes and used in other scenes. The first time that Shane and Ilya have sex in the book is actually in a hotel room and not Shane's like in house that he buys to fuck Ilya in. The dialogue for the first time they have sex in the penthouse is the dialogue that's used whenever they actually have sex the first time in the show. I don't know if I need that's making sense, but they condense some of the dialogue. And that's interesting to see what they use, what they don't use, what they've corrected, what they haven't corrected, or like what they've you know used for a medium. I find that to be particularly fascinating. Yeah, the creative choices I think were nice, which we'll talk about more later as we as we talk about like the end of this book. The last 50% of this book is Tampa is really where shit starts getting real. I'm just gonna keep talking about what's interesting to me. 50% of the weight into this book is where the fifth episode of the show takes place, which is crazy. I think 50% of the book into two episodes and you somehow fucking knelt it and they're like the two best episodes of TV I've seen this year. So how he did it? I don't know. I literally don't know. How soft to him. I mean, I know how he did it. He cuts some of the sex scenes of this book. I love the connection between characters and again, I think what really drew me to the story in the first place was self-loathing, the self-exploration on the parts of both of the characters, vulnerability that is born throughout the story and how it like really opens up near the end of the story on really refreshing. Yeah, I think that the narrative choices in this book, whether they were intentional or not, are very inspiring to me as someone who wants to write a book. I am very impressed with the sort of sparse writing. I like that there are little chunks of of like scenes. It's almost it's almost like the way that Jacob Tierney does these like fadans, you know, who fits the sex scenes. In the book, it's not fadans for sex scenes, but it's like little little chunks of a moment, the different Ilias point of view and then we get Shane's point of view. They're not in the same location or it's you know, it's great. It's great. The way this book is composed. Not everybody likes the book, not everybody likes the show, but it is in my hub looping in impressive. You know, I've said this recently about the foxhole court. I am endlessly impressed by authors who are able to tell a story in a way that connects with me that is not necessarily overwritten. I really really admire authors who make bold choices and who do things just the way they want to do them and they don't try to bend to convention or to what is, you know, expected in the genre, you know, beyond the happily ever after, of course. God, I'm yapping. And we still, we don't know like four fucking books to read. I think the long game is going to be more interesting in terms of like my commentary and I'm also scared to read it. I'm gonna be honest. We're gonna talk about the show later. We're gonna talk about my crack theories and everything later, okay? Okay, my friends. I am finished with heated rivalry. I am 50% into tough guy. Again, it's so fascinating reading this book having just finished the show, especially the finale, because I feel like the 50% mark on again, it's those episodes five and six, the ones that are really fresh in my mind. And I have to say I think that the show does such an excellent jaw that I taking the material and honestly enhancing it. I feel like when I watched episode six in particular, I was a little bit surprised initially that we didn't have more sexines because the fourth part of this book is very sex heavy and the entire book is sex heavy, but we do have a lot of sexines in the last part of this book. And I actually think that the choice to sort of pull back on that in episodes five and six and really focus on the emotional connection that happens in this part of the book was a really wise one. Not only from like a visual perspective, we could pick up on as people who are you know, simply watching the show and are like unfamiliar with the book. It's not that I don't enjoy the sexines in the latter part of the book. They are some like really sweet emotional tender moments, but I think it was most impressive to me as the dialogue that is taken from some of those sex moments and used in non-sexual contexts in the show. I actually find that to be maybe a little bit more impressive. I do still love this book though. I did love the last 50% of it. Like I always do. And I am just so curious to see where the show goes now with this, you know, material because the epilogue of this book is not included in the TV show. I'm sure that that is going to be picked up in the second season. Like I'm sure that that information is going to be present somewhere, but yeah, it was really interesting reading this book and just kind of seeing where it ends. It does have this sort of like, their sweet quality to it because on the one hand, Ilya and Shane are getting to have this romance that they have dreamed about, but also it doesn't get to look the way that everybody else does. They are still closeted. And the NHL, the only people that really know about their relationship are their, you know, family in the case of Shane and, you know, a couple of friends in the case of Ilya. And Ilya isn't even very close with people, so anyway, that's I guess a story for another time when it comes to like the long game, and you know, kind of those things coming up again, but I think this book ends in a way that is illistic, but also kind of bittersweet, so, no, I just, I do love this book. I do love this book, and it has been very inspiring to me as someone who wants to write, just seeing the narrative choices that were used, connection between these two characters, the self-loathing that they have that I don't feel like shows up very much in the show. Yeah, the book is its own unique thing, and I do really appreciate it for what it is. It's a five-star read for me. I'm not going to change my rating there. It's about tough guy though. He's an interesting one. I had heard this is most people's least favorite, either this one or I think common goal. I get mixed feedback on which people dislike more. Don't dislike this book, per se, but it is not necessarily as compelling to me as Scott and Kip Story, or Ilya and Shane's story. And I think the reason for that is there's not a whole lot going on in this book. Our main characters here are Ryan Price, who we meet in the last book in the series, and Fabian, who we have not met before. Fabian and Ryan do have a bit of a shared history. Apparently in like hockey, this is a thing, people go and stay with like host families, and one of the host families that Ryan stayed with when he was younger and like playing in juniors, I believe is what they call it. He met Fabian. Fabian was someone he knew, and he kind of had a crush on back then, but like didn't know, I guess, how to explore it and say him on the part of Fabian. Now Ryan is, I believe in Toronto, and I'm sure someone's going to say why do do you use the hard tea and Toronto, it's because I'm from Texas, okay? Toronto. He is in Toronto playing for a team. He has switched teams pretty much every season he has been in NHL, and he has largely understood, I would say this is a story about anxiety and mental health, and also the expectations others have for you versus kind of like personality you have yourself. Ryan is supposed to be kind of like a bruiser, like you know, one of the guys, the voresers on the team, who, you know, make sure that none of the other players get hurt, or if they do get hurt that he ruffs up the other team in response, but his personality in real life is very sweet and mild mannered. He's just kind of like an anxious little ball of energy. I say ball of energy. He's a chill guy. He's just like a little anxious, a little anxious guy playing rides kind of make him nervous, and he reconnects with Fabian, and he's just instantly attracted to this guy. He has always been attracted to maybe the more fam presenting aside of the spectrum. He is gay, but he tends to prefer more fam men. I don't feel like we often see that in romance, so I did actually really appreciate that. I am really appreciating that. I love Fabian because he really knows who he is and what he's about. He's a musician. He likes wearing makeup. He likes, you know, hanging out with his friends at gay bars, and Ryan is not necessarily out like out to the NHL, but there are definitely people who know that he's gay. I think his family knows he's gay, and he is living in basically the gay barhood of Toronto, and he is being kind of like shown around by Fabian and like getting to know other people in this community. He has friends specifically, and yeah, it's just sweet seeing him becoming embraced by people who maybe can see sides of him that others don't. I am appreciating that. I just think that the overall like plot of this book is maybe less exciting. I also think that the reading experience via audio book is maybe not the way to go with this series. I'm not saying the audio narration is horrible. I've read it, or I've never listened to any of the books in this series via audio. I do think that some authors writing lends itself better to audio than others, and I think that Rachel Reed's style of writing tends to be a little bit more cut and dry. I think sitting with it visually on the page, I think you can fill in the gaps a little bit better on your own versus listening to it via audio. It feels like someone's just rattling off information to me. There's been like fully sitting with it, and I mean, I'm sure part of that comes down to the narrator themselves, but I think a bigger part of that is just this way that the author tells the story. So I don't know. I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I feel very like ambivalent, weird, because I'm pretty sure I rated Game Changer 3 stars. It wasn't amazing, but I did really enjoy it, and this one I feel like I'm also rate 3 stars, even though I like to Game Changer more. So it's like, do I go back and read that four stars? It doesn't feel like a four star read. It's not, I feel like a two star read either, so I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I feel about this one. But I am excited to move on to the other two. I think those tend to be a little bit more agreed upon. I don't know. I say that. I think people tend to hate this one or a common goal. So I've been working out for me today. I'm trying to read three of these books today and save the long game for tomorrow. So you're locking in and buckling up with me, my friends, for the rest of us. Okay, so we finished tough guy, and I am 50% into, I was gonna say common goal. Is this the common goal? Yes, common goal by Rachel Reed, all of these books are by Rachel Reed. I'm being repetitive. Okay, so I think that picking up common goal immediately after actually helped solidify my feelings around tough guys. Just to say that I think that this book is sweet. And I did really like the kind of contrast of both like physical tears between characters and also their personalities. I do think that these characters were very distinct and feel like any other character I had read by Rachel Reed up until this point. So it was nice to get that sort of like difference. I already said this, but I have read some stand-alones by her as well. And I do think she does a good job at like having characters that feel pretty distinct. I would say the characters that feel maybe the most similar would be like Scott and Kip to Ilya and Shane. I know Ilya is a very distinct character, but I just mean that they're hockey players and they're very like typical kind of macho dudes. But the other character she writes they do tend to feel more distinct. And I do think that was the case in tough guy. Do you think that the representation of Ryan's anxiety was really great. And just his like insecurities around sex and some other things like made sense to me and it was cool to see how Fabian was so supportive of Ryan and how he also supported Ryan in maybe wanting to leave hockey like spoil exactly what happens. But Ryan has just ever really felt comfortable with his role that he plays on the team. He likes hockey but he's not in love with hockey like some of these other players. And I just thought it was interesting to see that contrast, but that being said, pairing this to something like common goal or even heated rivalry. I just don't have that sense of fun when I read this book. Like it doesn't feel like anything particularly grand is happening. And I'm not saying the plot of these books needs to be crazy, but beyond, you know, appreciating that she was doing something different with the characters. I wasn't like in love with what happens in this book. Just wasn't like a pleasure to read I would say. I mean, golly I'm really liking though. This book is about Eric and Kyle. Kyle is the bartender in the first book and we actually meet him in the show as well, which I think is fun. I'll be curious to see if we explore Kyle's story in the show going forward. Jacob Tierney has said he like might do that. He definitely wants to incorporate characters from some of the other books, but we'll see if we end up getting Kyle's love story. I'm liking it in the book though. I think that the flirting and the banter and the tension is super, super great. So Kyle is a bartender at the Kingfisher. Kip is also a bartender at this point now. We also have Eric who is a pretty old near retirement age goalie. So he's like 41. And I think that Kyle is like 25. And the story really opens with Eric. He recently divorced from his wife and also trying to sort of they discover his actuality. He knows he's bisexual, but he has never been with men. And he is interested in potentially trying out men, you know, pursuing that instead of pursuing women at the moment. But he doesn't really know where to start. And he ends up flirting with Kyle at the bar, but Kyle has had some bad luck with older men in the past, even though that's definitely his type. So he's trying to keep like at kind of arms distance, arms, arms like type of a boy from him because he doesn't trust himself around Eric. Even though Eric has proven to be a very nice guy and they definitely have common interests, which is art. I think Kyle is going to grad school for art similar to Kip. And Eric is just a really big fan of art. He's the more intellectual hockey player, shall we say. I also appreciate it because most of the guys that we've been introduced to are not necessarily intellectuals, which is not a bad thing, but it's just cool to see that contrast. We're kind of in a situation at this 50% mark where Eric is going to potentially have some sex lessons from Kyle. Kyle's not trying to get to attached, but he does really like Eric and find him endearing. And so he's like, you know what? I flirt with guys for a living. I mean bartender, but he like flirts with his customers. And so he's like, I think I can help Eric find someone perfect for him. And so that's what he's doing. I'm sure they're going to fall in love. And they both very much sexual feelings towards each other, but they have not acted on those. They have had one kiss. Both parties thought it was sexy and memorable. And yeah, I don't know. I'm just I'm having a good time with this one. There's this attacks conversation that I read between the two of them. And it actually made me audibly giggle. Oh, just such a big contrast, I think, between this book and tough guy. But it sucks because I liked the characters and tough guy. I just feel like the way it was written and the just the lack of like fun just wasn't wasn't really what I was looking for personally. I think it was true to the characters, but just not really what I was like here for. So so far so good. I'm liking this one. And I think this one is feeling more promising for sure. What's also promising is dinner for my cats. I don't know if you guys can hear binky screaming, but he wants dinner. So I'm going to go ahead and feed the boys and finish this book and then get started on roll model. My mind, I was like, oh, a new setting, a new setting is a good idea. Was it a good idea though? I look fucking horrifying. I did finish the book. I am 50% into another book. And I'm having a great time. Happy Sunday, my friends. You're going to be seeing this the day that I'm filming it because I have been slower reading than I thought that I would. But that's okay. That's okay. First, let's talk about not tough guy, not roll model, common goal, common goal. I do think they had things in common. The common goal, I think was the whole. The whole was the goal in this case. I thought this was cute actually. I think this is definitely the, I don't want to say horny a book that Rachel reads ever written. I think that he did rivalries probably the one that contains the most sex scenes like per page or per however this one has dirty talking from Kyle that I just simply was not expecting. I won't lie, I wasn't expecting that from Kyle, but go Kyle. I really liked the way that there was the tension between the two of them and the way that Kyle didn't feel like he should be with an older guy, even though he likes older guys. And Eric was like, what are people going to think of me if I'm with this young guy? Like, I don't want people to think I'm having a midlife crisis, even though I really like him. And it was cute. It wasn't anything remarkable though. And I was talking to a friend about this. I think that the problem with this book and the last one, tough guy, or that they're just, there's not really relationship development going on right? Like, yes, we have two people who are into each other who are fucking and they find ways to overcome challenges. Maybe it's like, conceive notions they have about their partner or about what the world will think about them. But we're not really getting like, I don't know these two like falling in love. Like, I don't know how to really put that into words. They're not like spending a ton of time together outside of the fucking like, there's not a connection beyond the physical. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like, I'm having a fun time with all of these books. I don't think any of them are unpleasant. None of these things, you know, make these books unenjoyable. I think it works in heated rivalry again because these two have something in common. We know that their relationship has been building over years and it's like the small things that sort of like bring them together almost, you know, like, I know that you like ginger ale and I'm gonna have that stalked for you and like, we're gonna talk about the fact that your mom died and like, there's actual things going on there. And I feel like there's less going on in some of these other books. That being said, this book I'm reading right now does have things going on. So anyway, my review, my overall like, ratings, feelings, whatever about common goal. It's gonna be three stars. I rated, have I rated all of these books three stars so far besides heated rivalry? Yes. But I think that that makes sense based on enjoyment and also craft. That's chat. Let's chat about this one because I'm liking this one a lot more. Well, model is Troy and Harris's story. We have gotten hints about Troy in previous books. But we didn't really know if he was gonna get a redemption arc because he is best friend with a sexual predator. This book is really his redemption arc. He didn't really know that his friend was that shitty of a person, but being a closeted gay man, he felt like it almost, I don't want to say made sense to like hide behind someone so shitty and bigoted. He is not like a typical nice guy anyway. Like Troy is just this kind of like quiet, rough kind of guy. And so he just, he had behind the shitty guy in Toronto for a while. And when he finds out that his friend has sexually assaulted women, he decides to believe women, which is what you should do. And he ends approaching this guy practice and screaming at him getting mad and he gets kicked off the team basically or traded to Ottawa. And Ottawa is not a good team. We know this because we've brought the long game already. Ottawa is not a good team, but Ilya is playing there so that he could be ashamed. And so we get a lot of Ilya in this book, but Troy ends up following for the social media guy Harris, who is an openly out gay guy. It's just really nice and sweet and fun. And to say he's unlike any of the other heroes that I've read in Rachel Reed books, but I do think to her credit, she does a really good job in making these characters feel distinct. Maybe not all of the hockey players, but like the characters who are not hockey players do feel very distinct. Kyle doesn't feel anything like Harris, Harris doesn't feel like like literally any of these guys. So I appreciate that. Harris, like he's fun, he's sweet, he talks a lot, but he's not hyperactive. And I say that because I've read another book by her where we've got like Casey who is like very, very talkative and this guy is not like that. Yeah, Troy finds Harris to be kind of a safe space and a safe place to land after, you know, his upbringing after being on this team with this shitty guy, feeling like he finally wants to change a little bit and maybe potentially come out and like be who he wants to be. He's fresh off of a breakup. Troy, that is, is really bummed. Like his sort of like two years who he had, they were both closeted at the time, is now openly, openly guy. He's come out and he's engaged to another man. And yeah, Troy's just like feeling very lost. His dad is pretty homophobic and it's kind of an asshole. His dad like left his mom recently. And I just think that Troy, he feels very directionless. He doesn't think his team likes him. He doesn't think anybody likes him and he regrets his association with that guy Dallas Kent, sexual predator. And so he's he's struggling. And I like that he's trying to make amends and I think that the story is going to be him really standing up for his women and really, you know, making amends for, you know, not not knowing that this guy was shitty. And also, you know, maybe feeling like he is in a safe enough space to come out because there are, I think, okay, guys, on the team, he knows for sure at this point that Ilya is by. And I think he's kind of suspecting that Ilya is with Shane. I don't want to spoil this, but I'm going to add okay. There's a moment in this book where that homophobic piece of shit who still plays for Toronto starts saying some shit to Ilya on the ice and Ilya beats him up. And that was pretty nice. I like to think that I won't tell you what was said, but I was like, oh, yeah, that was cool. This one definitely feels different than the other. It feels more akin to long game. It has some similarities. I would say with heated rivalry in terms of the tone of it. And I do think I like that. I think I prefer Rachel Reed is in her angsty bag. I think she does a really good job at that. The two stand alone she has. One of them is like an upbeat Christmasy like fun. I don't know like first love kind of story. And then the other one is an angsty, I can't chance like heart, heartbroken sort of situation. I really liked. I just think that she really excels in the kind of more heartbreaking moments. I mean, I really did like time to shine her like, you know, sweeter one too, but that other stand alone. I really like, I liked, he'd rather play like long game. I think I just think that she does a good job with kind of the harder topics actually. I think that maybe she struggles a little bit more when there's not as much going on for her characters. And I think that that's okay. Like I think that everybody has their own thing when it comes to writing like what they excel at and what they thrive in. And I think she thrives with like the harder emotions and the sort of like tougher storylines. And I think that my and Harris' story is kind of in the middle like it's not like their relationship itself isn't super angsty, but the things that Troy's going through. And I think that that makes this one a little bit more compelling maybe than some of the others. So I'm having to the time with it genuinely. I think that this one, I'm liking the romance as well. Like I think that we're moving into pace that feels good. I like that Troy, he comes clean to Harris pretty quickly about his sexuality. Like they have kind of like a sexual moment and at the end of it, Troy ends up leaving and Harris is like, okay, is this guy closeted? Like is he bought? Like what's going on here? Like why isn't he being honest with me? Was this like a fuck up one time thing? And then Troy's like, no, actually like, okay, I've been with a man before. I was in a relationship. Yeah, it's just, it's nice that he can be honest with this one person. And I really like that. And that's like a sweet concept, the idea of like finding the person who you can be really honest with, even if at the beginning don't necessarily see it as romantic or like you don't know if it's going to go anywhere, just like knowing that you have that person you can confide in. I think it's really sweet. So again, kind of nervous to go into the long game. I mean, I'm excited too. Because I feel like I've read a heated rivalry so many times this year in various ways as the show has been coming out, etc. So I think reading the long game will be fun. I think I'm also going to be like overthinking the fuck out of it. Like, oh my god, how are they going to make this into a TV show? We'll talk about that once we get to there. But yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. I have a lot of thoughts on that. I trust Jacob Tierney with my fucking life. I do, but I'm nervous. I'm nervous to see that on screen. Okay, okay. I'm going to finish this one. I'm going to stay focused on Troy and Harris. Okay, I am. I am. Hello, friends. I am back on my baby hammer again. I'll get on the big one in a second, but I'm just so into the mini-mic and I know that it is hotly debated whether or not people like these things, but I'm just going to let you know in the new year. I did, in fact, get mini-mikes for my big camera. So the video quality is going to be crispy and the audio is going to sound similar to this. So I hope you don't hate it. I also kind of don't care because I'm excited about it anyway. I finished role model and 50% into the long game. My emotions are all over the place, but I really like the role model. I think I'm going to give it four stars. It was definitely the best of this series outside of Shane and Ilya's story. I really, I like Rachel Reads writing. I feel like I'm just going to say growing to Leica. I mean, I like her writing. I think that I, again, just like really appreciate what she can do with harder topics. Again, this one still had a levity that I really appreciated. So I say our hero. Our hockey player comes out to his mom. He does eventually come out to his team and just publicly. His dad is an asshole, but he basically tells his dad to fuck off immediately. It's not something that's like really drawn out. I don't want to say it's not traumatic. That's obviously very traumatic to have someone not accept you, but I like that we didn't spend too much time lingering there. It was really just about Troy and Harris getting to love each other and be happy. And to the end of this book, it was just very nice. And I also just like to see Troy's character grow and how much he was willing to stand up for people. I like seeing Dallas can't get his come up in. It was just, it was a really nice book. I really enjoyed it. In the moments of Ilya, who are great as well, just a supportive, great guy all around. And it is very clear to me that he is Rachel Leeds favorite. Talk about that again later. Let's talk about the long game that I'm 50% of the way into like this book a lot. I read this book. I guess it was probably only a couple weeks ago at this point. Maybe about a month ago. I read it right after Thanksgiving because I started watching the TV show when I was like, I have to know how their story ends. I struggle with my mental health quite a bit. And Ilya struggled with his I think was very validating. I do, I do feel very seen in both Shane and Ilya like Shane's neurodivergence. Representations incredible. The way he's written is great, but the way that he is in the show is even better relate to Shane a lot. I also really relate to Ilya's depression and the way that that is represented. I think that Rachel really does really drop it writing both things. It really hit me. The depression representation really hit me because I don't know. I feel like often in books, mental health representation is overwritten, overwrought and it tends to take over the character's entire life. And yes, mental health can take over your entire life, but I think that there's can reduce characters to just those things. And I don't see that in Rachel's reads right in. You know, Ilya is trying so hard to be the person that Shane thinks he is. And Shane is trying to like support him, but doesn't necessarily know how. Yeah, so anyway, I guess I should maybe tell you what this book is about. This book's fashion, no, yeah, it is a continuation of their story. And I don't necessarily want to spoil the events of the last book, but you know, we kind of are left on this sort of like copy. Oh, they're going to be together note, but also these two are going to have to be closeted for a while. It's sort of a bittersweet moment. And coming into this book, you know, that that is the case. And we pick up pretty much right off right where we left off, Jaden and Ilya are having to keep their relationship secret. And it is affecting them both, but they are kind of unable to share those feelings with each other. Ilya thinks that he is weak for wanting to not wanting to show his relationship to the world, but I think for not being able to handle fact that he wants to show his relationship to everybody. Shane definitely wants to be able to touch his man in public and to claim him publicly, but just doesn't know how to communicate that and is too concerned with what the world would think. I think Ilya is less concerned about what the world thinks Shane is more concerned about it, but they both have valid concerns, right? And I think that when I hear people discuss this book, a lot of people tend to shit on Shane. I think part of that is the writing, but his fears are very valid. This is something that he is very committed to, which I'll read his said this. Ilya, he likes being good at something and he loves playing hockey against Shane, but hockey is not his world like this for Shane. So it makes sense for Shane to react the way that he does to everything and to feel like he can't, he can't come out with like ruin his entire life. Yeah, we're left in this kind of interesting place at the beginning of the book where we see these moments of them wanting to be together and not being able to communicate that. Like you're in the same space and you have the same feelings, but you can't say those feelings out loud. It's kind of reminiscent of parts of the first book in that way, and we also have some very very sexual, very hot moments as well. So it's kind of interesting totally. And I guess that's similar kind of in some ways to the tone of heated rival where you've got this incredibly intense intimate passionate sex. You also have characters who are not able to speak their feelings. And it's interesting because these characters they can't say I love you now, and they can show up for each other in some ways, but not fully not in the way that they want to. So it is an interesting approach, and I do think it's an interesting book. And it feels true to the characters for sure, at least for now. There are some things that happen later on in this book that I am aware of that I don't feel are as true to characters as maybe I would like, but they're also not my characters. I didn't write them, but we can discuss that later. So it feels weird to be coming to a close in the series. I don't want it to be over. I don't want the vlog to be over. And this is probably really fucking long gone too. I'm kind of scared to edit this, but yeah, what a time? What a time. Oh, and then you got my yapping at the end. I totally forgot about that. Okay, I better make sure my camera's charged for that SD card locked and loaded ready for that. I'll see you when I'm done. Okay, friends, I finished it. I finished the long game, and I have many thoughts. The last 50% of this book is tough for me because there's a lot of things that I like, and a lot of things that I really don't like. I think the biggest thing that I don't like about this book and that a lot of people have complained about about this book be Shane's character assassination. And I think that in heated rivalry, there is a little bit more of like fairness, I guess you could say, between Shane and Ilya and how Rachel Reed treats them as characters. But as the series goes on, we see Ilya in nearly every other book in the series, and it's, I mean, he's a character that Rachel Reed obviously really likes and kind of in a lot of ways prefers to Shane. So when she revisits their story in a long game, she basically gives Shane an eating disorder and doesn't want to call it that and doesn't want to address it at all. But like, that's very clearly something that he's struggling with, and it never really gets resolved in any meaningful way. He is also not the best partner to Ilya. I mean, a lot of his, I guess, feelings are justified and not wanting to come out, and not wanting to jeopardize his career. That makes sense to me. Some of the ways in which he is unable to like pick up on the way Ilya is feeling is frustrating. Is there a divergent person? I can say that we're all different for sure. And I do have a hard time sometimes reading the subtlety in expressions. But when you've been with someone for as long as Shane has been with Ilya, you do learn people's cells and you do learn how to help the people around you. Yes, Ilya keeps things bottled up. I get that. But it just seemed a little out of character for Shane to not be more concerned about Ilya. And I thought that even before watching the TV show where I think Shane is even kinder and more perceptive and more artistically coded. So anyway, that was frustrating for me to read and remains frustrating. And I also think that while the sexes hot in this book and while I liked seeing these two get their happy, happily ever after their happy ending, I was a little bit not a fan of some of the ways in which we get there. Ilya rightfully calls out Shane and the way that he doesn't necessarily give up anything in this relationship. Like Ilya has literally gone from a winning team to the worst team in the league for Shane. It's a huge sacrifice to someone who's competitive and wants to win. I mean, maybe hockey isn't as important to him as it is to Shane, but it still matters to him, right? And he doesn't have a lot of friends. He's given up a lot basically for Shane. Shane has not given up a lot for Ilya. Ilya calls him out for that. Shane doesn't really understand and is bitchy about it. Eventually he apologizes and sees the error of his ways, but I think he only truly sees the error of his ways when Ilya is in like grave danger. I don't want to tell you why that is because I don't want to spoil this book for you if you decide to pick up these books and the series as a whole because I think you should. It didn't love that. And then there is, um, I don't want to tell you how this book ends. So I'm not going to tell you how it begins. There are, you know, typical, I guess one would say happily ever after things that happen. And I think that some of the details were maybe a little corny. The reasons for those things happening also were a little corny. So I'm just left with sort of like not knowing how to feel about this book. I rated it initially five stars. I'm probably going to keep that rating because I love these characters so much. But as a whole, this book is really frustrating because I love seeing Ilya his depression journey. There was a fucking paragraph that really stuck out to me and perfectly encapsulated and articulated how I'm feeling right now, which is Ilya basically saying it is so frustrating to know that you're doing everything in your power to help yourself. You're going to therapy. You may be unmeds. You have 11 family and friends and you feel like you're in a good place, but like, realizing that unfortunately you can't get rid of this thing, that really hit me, that really hit me, because that's where I'm at right now. I actually talk about that in the vlog where I read those two, you know, standalone, formal, ritual, read. Yeah, that's just a wife and kind of gone this month. If you're curious, stuff's coming your way in January, but like it's been hard for me to do things. I mean, mental health has been bad and despite all of my best efforts, you know, it's not not not great. It makes feelings about this book, but I'm going to give it five stars. I'm going to give it five stars. I love these characters and I just can't believe this series is over. I can't believe I have to wait until 2027 to spend more time with them. Kills me, but had such a fun time reading all of these and I did want to have some time to talk about the show. How fucking great it is. I talked about it a couple of times on my channel as the show started coming out, but I think that a lot of you probably know at this point what a cultural phenomenon this show has been. It just so important to me in so many different ways, like seeing that on screen, autism, rev, felt so real. First of all, like that is that huge, right? Seeing just the hints of Ilias depression in this as well, they did a really good job sort of like laying the groundwork for that when they, you know, do a season two. The cinematography is stunning. The way that this book has been perfectly adapted for the screen and in some ways I think is better than the book. It's remarkable to me. I think the biggest thing that I have taken away from this show is not only like queer joy and how we can all come together in a really hard time and celebrate that. But on top of that, what I think we should all take away from this is that we need more shows like this. We need more incredible romance adaptations. It's what the people crave. The people want yearning, they want longing, they want romance. If we all want that, we're all seeking connection right now in a time when it's like very challenging to seek that connection. It has been just wildly inspiring to watch this show and to see how many people are obsessed with it. It makes me want to write my own book, which is something that I will be doing throughout the course of 2026. Like I'm actually prioritizing that for once in my life. It's just very inspiring to see how good this show is, how many people are loving it. And yeah, just like what what joy it's brought people like I am not doing a good job at articulating my feelings. I have been, I feel like giving dissertation type answers to my friends about why I think they should watch this show and what an impact it's had on me. But really as a romance lover and reader and someone whose whole career centers around this to see something like this get made is remarkable. And I've seen other romance authors talk about this. The way that they talk about it is the way that I feel, which is this is so important. It's so fucking cool that we live in a time where this is happening. And it it sounds like hyperbole and maybe it is, but it is actually that important. And it is actually that, um, serious to me, someone who again does this for a living. So I love the show. I love these books. And I would love to know your thoughts and feelings on them as well. Obviously not all of the books are perfect. I, you know, mostly am here for Shana Nilea, but yeah, I am so curious about the next season. I'm curious as to how many seasons we're gonna get. That's something that I am very curious about. I would love to know your theories if you're like really invested in this. But Jacob Turnie has said he has a number of seasons in mind. And he has said that he doesn't necessarily think that it's going to be longer seasons either. So we're gonna get like probably six episodes seasons. I'm wondering how, how long we're going to go with this. And I guess that, that, that is kind of something I wanted to bring up. Although I guess I kind of did, I find about what I find fun about the show to is show really respect Shane as a character. Um, Hudson Williams acting is I think the unsung hero of this show. Obviously, Connor story does an incredible job at Hudson Williams is his autism wrap in this show. And also how much life he brings to Shane has been really cool to see. And I saw this TikTok circulating. I'm really rambling at this point. I saw this TikTok circulating. It was an Instagram post for Rachel Reed of notes that she had about her characters. It was basically just ripping Shana part from the woman herself. Yeah, it's just so interesting. I mean, I'm sure that that was probably not supposed to be taken super seriously. But how authors like perceive their characters versus how other people do. Shana's really special to me. So it makes me sad that she doesn't like him more as a character. But I think that that will also sort of affect the way that a long game is adapted. I think that we are very generous with Shane in the first book adaptation, like in the first season of the show. So I'm curious to see what changes they had up making to the show because of that because we all love Shane and are invested in him. You can't, I think, adapt the book without making some changes, right? Whether it's to the intent behind certain things or the way things are said. I mean, even in the first season of the show, there are lines of dialogue that feel so much different seeing it on screen than versus, you know, in the book. So yeah, very curious to see where we go with season two. If there's going to be more than one season, here's my hot take of the day. I think that they should only do two seasons of the show. One, because I think Conner and Hudson are going to be highly in demand. And I think that they should get their shine and other, you know, opportunities. I also just don't think that we need more than two seasons. I mean, I'm not going to bitch because I'm sure Jacob Tierney has like a vision and he knows what he wants. I know that Hudson and Conner are technically signed on for three seasons, though this show has only been renewed for two, like four seasons too. So yeah, I'll be curious to see. I don't think that it's going to be more than three, but I'm wondering how you would even break up the long game, anyway. So I just like my thoughts and feelings and theories. So grateful for the show. This show really has been just like the highlight of the year for me for sure. I look as asked for life now. That I feel like I didn't previously. This time of year is really hard for me. So to have this has been really, really special and I'll always have my rewatches, you know what I mean. I don't know if you mentioned it also in this video, but if you want to see some really heartening stuff, empty netters podcast and the what chaos hockey podcasts, please shit, they do incredible reviews of this show. It's presumably two groups of straight men talking about the show very seriously and I find it really heartening. So yeah, this show brings people together, baby, this whole, brings people together and it's just so fun to get to talk about it. So it's for humoring me. I hope that you enjoyed this and this was already, you know, on this schedule for this month, but I know that you're probably like Taylor. You said that you're going to do good read choice word videos where the fuck are those? They are coming. Yeah, I have purchased all of the books so like it's definitely happening. I'm not letting those books go to waste, but they're just going to be mostly in January. January, I can't talk today. January. So if I'm clapped for that, I'm also going to be reading your favorite books of the year. I have that in a community post by the way. A link form if you still want to submit your favorite books of 2025 and have me read those. I will be doing that January, but so much watching this. I love you all so much and I'll see you on the next one.
